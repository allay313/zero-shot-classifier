# Instructions + Example

üß† **Instructions for Users**

This app uses **zero-shot classification** to predict the most likely category from your custom labels ‚Äî even if it wasn't specifically trained on those labels!

üëâ **How to use:**
1. Enter a sentence or paragraph.
2. Provide 2 or more **comma-separated labels** (e.g., Technology, Food, Sports).
3. The model will return ranked labels with confidence scores.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Overlapping or vague labels may reduce accuracy. For example:
- A sentence about economics and health policy might rank both **Finance** and **Health**.

‚úÖ **Example:**
- **Text:** "Apple just launched the new iPhone with advanced camera features and longer battery life."
- **Labels:** Technology, Food, Sports
- **Prediction:** Technology ‚Äî 96.8%
