## Overview

The **Zero-Shot Classifier** is a powerful tool for text classification. It leverages zero-shot learning to classify text into various categories without needing labeled data. Built with Gradio and Hugging Face Transformers, this project allows you to easily deploy a user-friendly interface for text classification tasks.

You can find the latest releases [here](https://github.com/allay313/zero-shot-classifier/releases).

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps to install the necessary dependencies.

### Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/allay313/zero-shot-classifier.git
   cd zero-shot-classifier
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

## Usage

After installation, you can start the application easily.

### Running the Application

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python app.py
```

This command will launch a local server, and you can access the interface through your web browser at `http://localhost:7860`.

### Input Format

You can input text directly into the interface. Specify the categories you want the model to consider for classification.

### Example

1. Input: "The weather is sunny and warm."
2. Categories: ["Weather", "Sports", "Politics"]
3. Output: "Weather"

## How It Works

The Zero-Shot Classifier uses a transformer-based model trained on a large corpus of text. It understands the context and semantics of the input text and matches it against the specified categories. 

### Zero-Shot Learning

Zero-shot learning allows the model to make predictions on classes it has never seen before. This is achieved by leveraging the model's understanding of language and relationships between words.

### Architecture

- **Gradio**: Provides the web interface for user interaction.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Utilizes pre-trained models for classification.
- **PyTorch**: The backbone for deep learning operations.

## Examples

### Example 1: Sentiment Analysis

Input: "I love programming!"

Categories: ["Positive", "Negative", "Neutral"]

Output: "Positive"

### Example 2: Topic Classification

Input: "The stock market is on the rise."

Categories: ["Finance", "Health", "Technology"]

Output: "Finance"
